Objective
===

Make a responsive page demonstrating CSS-only animations. Follow the Webpack component and router architecture using vanilla JS. Use the Hamburger Menu as primary mobile navigation method. Implement CSS transforms, transitions, animations in a user-friendly way.

Steps Taken
===

Created a CSS only hamburger menu that utilized an input checkbox with opacity: 0 overlayed on the icon. With input:checked, click behavior was created with the navigation and hamburger menu. Have the nav appear in little blocks that float downward. When a page is selected from the nav, have that page elastically shake into view. When a button is clicked in the page, have a plus icon rotate and slowly show text by changing the opacity. I used CSS animations / transitions to accomplish each of these effects. 


Reflection / Changes
===

I initially wanted to try a drawer nav bar, but the component architecture would've made it very hard to complete within the time constraints. I instead created a nav that appears to have its items appear and fall into place. In the future, I would like to try to create a hide/show CSS-only button within the page content that would have the content adjust when the button is clicked.
